WMP can only fullscreen once a video has been loaded, which means we have to attach the "start video fullscreen" preference code to the Playing event of the WMP control. However, if this check is made every time the playing event is fired, then if the user makes the choice of exiting fullscreen, then pauses the player and plays it again, fullscreen will be entered again - when they specifically chose to exit fullscreen. So at the start of loading each video I will set this to false, then at the end of the "playing" event for each player, I will set it to true. Then the fullscreen code for each player will check that this variable is false before making the WMP control fullscreen. Even though this isn't necessary for the quicktime player (it can go fullscreen before the video is loaded, so doesnt need events), I will make it work this way too for consistency.
